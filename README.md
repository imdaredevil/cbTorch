# CBTorch - My own pytorch implementation

Writing my own implementation of pytorch from numpy.

The final aim of this repo is to contain code in numpy to train Gpt2 ( possibly llama3 ) and get reported performance.

- Next step is to train a sentiment classifier using transformer. 
- gpu support using cupy
